# recipe_finder
Recipe Finder is a simple web app built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that lets users search for recipes either from a small local JSON file or from the public [TheMealDB API].
It features a live search filter, dynamic recipe cards with images, ingredients, and measures, and an option to browse recipes by cuisine/area. The interface is styled with responsive cards, a dropdown for region selection, and a loading spinner for smooth user experience.
